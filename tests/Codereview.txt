Code Review Comments

    The suite uses both getByText and CSS selectors. Where possible, prefer data-testid attributes or ARIA roles to ensure selectors are less fragile and not impacted by text changes.

    The invalid user test has a commented-out expectation. This should be active to fully verify error handling. Make sure the error message is reliably displayed for edge cases.

    The test for no profile visible before search assumes the first image (probably a logo or placeholder) is always visible. Instead, verify that the actual user profile UI is not rendered before a search.

    Consider organizing tests using test.describe groups for better readability and separating positive, negative, and state validation tests.

    Add explicit assertions before user actions to verify initial UI state (e.g., placeholder in input, button disabled).

    For enhanced coverage, test edge cases: empty input, rapidly repeated searches, network errors, or searches with special characters.

    Abstract repeated selectors (input, button, etc.) as constants or utility functions to avoid duplication and improve maintainability.

    Use Playwright’s test.beforeEach for navigation setup if all tests navigate to the same page, reducing code repetition.

    Ensure error messages are localized or accessible via ARIA for more robust and accessible tests.
